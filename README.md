## 🎮 Video Game Sales & Popularity Analysis

### 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **descriptive data analysis** of global video game sales, completed as part of my Data Analytics program with CareerFoundry. I was tasked with helping a fictional game development company, **GameCo**, use historical sales data to inform their future development and marketing strategies.

Using a dataset from [VGChartz](http://www.vgchartz.com/), this project answers several key business questions related to game popularity, market trends, and regional performance using Excel-based data analytics techniques.
